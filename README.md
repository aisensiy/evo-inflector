About
=====

Evo Inflector implements English pluralization algorithm based on ["Damian Conway's"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Conway) paper ["An Algorithmic Approach to English Pluralization"](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~damian/papers/HTML/Plurals.html).

The tests performed (May 2014) based on data from [Wiktionary](http://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiktionary/latest/) show that:
- for entire set of 163518 words from Wiktionary, Evo Inflector returns correct answer for 68.4% of them,
- for 979 words marked as basic words almost all answers are correct, the sole exception being the word ['worse'](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/worse) which when used as a noun does not have a plural form,
- for 24.9% of all words Evo Inflector returns some form, but the word is marked as uncountable in Wiktionary,
- for 4.1% of all words Wiktionary does not specify the plural form for given word so whatever Evo Inflector returns will always be wrong,
- for 2.6% Evo Inflector returns an answer which is different than the one provided in Wiktionary.

(If you are curious this test is part of the [unit tests](https://github.com/atteo/evo-inflector/blob/master/src/test/java/org/atteo/evo/inflector/EnglishInflectorTest.java).)
